Project Khoj is an AI based Search Recommendation System which uses Image Classifier with
Color Extractor and a NLP based ChatBot to provide the user a concise list of fashion
products based on his/her interaction with the above mentioned interactors.

The user can use either the ChatBot or the Image Classifier to generate filters for the search
recommendation. The project uses Jsoup API to extract the product name, price, description
and the corresponding product list based the user input/ interaction from Flipkar, Jabong
and Snapdeal.
