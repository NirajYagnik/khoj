# Object Recognition using TensorFlow and Java

This small demo was written in Java to recognize objects in images and classify it into 1000 classes like Lion, Frog, Flowers, ....etc using Inception V3 model.

The pre-trained Inception V3 model can be downloaded from  here https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/inception_dec_2015.zip
